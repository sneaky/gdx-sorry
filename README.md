Sorry! The Board Game implemented in Java using the libGDX game development framework.

This is a very early test to make sure the fundamentals are solid before moving on to the ruleset.

To run the game, open build.gradle with your preferred Java IDE.
Then open the Gradle tab which is on the right side of the screen on Android Studio and IntelliJ IDEA.
After building, in the gradle tab under desktop > tasks > other you should see a 'run' task. This will make sure to run the desktop app.
